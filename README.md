# WeatherApp
This is a simple Weather App built using React.js, which allows users to search for weather information for a specific location. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

# Features:
- Search for weather information by entering a city name.
- Displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed.
- Support Celsius unit for temperature display.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices
- User-Friendly Interface: The interface provides a visually appealing and intuitive user experience.

# Technologies Used
- React.js: The app is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- OpenWeatherMap API: The OpenWeatherMap API is used to retrieve weather data.
- HTML5/CSS3: The app utilizes HTML5 and CSS3 for structuring and styling the user interface.
- Axios: Axios is used to make HTTP requests and handle API data retrieval.
- ES6: The app utilizes ES6 features and syntax for modern JavaScript development.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
